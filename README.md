# Dynacontroller
The dynacontroller PCB can be used either use as a standalone MIDI controller, or be installed in a larger sculptural installation. Optional phoenix connectors allow the user to connect external touchpoint to the PCB. 

The design for the touchpoints is pulled from the original dynacontroller sculpture. Learn more about this project at [dynamandala.com](www.dynamandala.com).
